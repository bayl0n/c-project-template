# C Project Template

This is a small project template that gives you everything you need to run your C programs.

## Compiling and running your program

As your project grows, you will need to edit the `makefile` to include new C files.

Compiling and running your program is both handled by the `run.sh` script.

## Defaults

Feel free to edit the `makefile` but by default, `ansi` C is enabled, as well as `Wall` and `Werror`.

## Default Flags
* -ansi
* -Wall
* -Werror
